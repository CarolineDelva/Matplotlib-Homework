## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to analyze a ridesharing company's complete recordset of rides. The datasets contain information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

The final report includes each of the following:

### A Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship between four key variable: 
- Average Fare ($) Per City
- Total Number of Rides Per City
- Total Number of Drivers Per City
- City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

### Three pie charts:
- % of Total Fares by City Type
- % of Total Rides by City Type
- % of Total Drivers by City Type

## Methods Used
* Data Visualization
* Data Analysis 
* Descriptive Analysis

## Technologies
* Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Jypyter Notebook)

## Needs of this project

- data analysis
- descriptive statistics
- data processing


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. CSVs can be found in the [Resources](https://github.com/CarolineDelva/Pyber-Matplotlib-Project/tree/master/Pyber/data) in this repository.

3. The Python script is located in the [HeroesOfPymoli](https://github.com/CarolineDelva/HeroesofPymoli-Pandas-Project/blob/master/HeroesOfPymoli/HeroesOfPymoli_starter.ipynb) folder.
4. Run the script in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

As final considerations:

## Conclusion
- Of the 1163 active players, the vast majority are male (84%). There also exists, a smaller, but notable proportion of female players (14%).

- Our peak age demographic falls between 20-24 (44.8%) with secondary groups falling between 15-19 (18.60%) and 25-29 (13.4%).
